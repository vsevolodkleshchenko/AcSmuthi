# AcSmuthi
This is the package for modelling of acoustic scattering on 
particles. It solves the Helmholtz equation with finding
the spherical waves expansion coefficients in all the system using the 
T-matrix method and calculates all the variables using these coefficients.


## How to use?
The main example of using the package is shown in `run.py`. To do that:
```commandline
poetry run python run.py
```


## What can it do?
* Compute and render pressure near-fields
* Calculate scattering and extinction cross-sections
* Calculate forces acting on particles


## Installation
Now, package is not published on pypi and available only with cloning from github 


## What realized now?
* Plane wave scattering on compressible spherical particles in fluid medium
